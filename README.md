# DrivingExamARK

DrivingExamARK program was designed for the purpose of finding an open driving exam time on the Estonian DMV website, when the median waiting time was ~3 months
(ca 2020). The program allows the user to select a city and then periodically check whether an exam time has opened up in said city in the current and the next month.
When a suitable exam time has been found, a notification will be sent to the user's entered email.

## Getting Started

Python3, aswell as the required packages, are needed to execute the program.
